    <h1>Create a Facebook like Notifications Window using jQuery and CSS</h1>
    <p><span class="Quote">Facebook, as we know, is a popular site for hanging
        out and sharing your priced possessions (like pictures etc) with family
        and friends. Of course, you can do and lot more than just sharing
        pictures on Facebook. However, for web developers and a newbie it’s an
        inspiration, a place to explore new idea and techniques. Here, I’ll show
        you how to create a Facebook style notifications window using jQuery and
        CSS.</span></p>
    <p>I have made few changes in my example here. I am not using any images.
      However, I have added some <a href="http://www.encodedna.com/css-tutorials/how-to-display-animated-text-over-faded-image-on-hover.htm"
        target="_blank" class="contact">animation</a> using jQuery <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000;">.animate()</span>
      method and used CSS properties to design the notifications box and the top
      navigation bar.</p>
    <p>DEMO</p>
    <p>Browser Support: <br>
      <span style="color:#000;font-style:italic;">Chrome 39.0 - Yes | FireFox
        34.0 - Yes | Internet Explorer 10 - Yes | Safari 5.1.4 - Yes</span></p>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>It is just an example and the idea behind creating this example is to
      learn some <a href="http://www.encodedna.com/angularjs/tutorial/add-css-animation-to-angularjs-app.htm"
        target="_blank" class="contact">basic animation</a> and style using
      jQuery methods and CSS properties.</p>
    <p>First, add the Google CDN for jQuery inside the &lt;head&gt; tag.</p>
    <pre class="pre">&lt;script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.1/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <p>Now let’s get on with the example and create the style first.</p>
    <div class="frmname">The Style</div>
    <p>Add the below style tag within the &lt;head&gt; tag. It’s a basic design
      to <a href="http://www.encodedna.com/2013/01/css-animated-dropdown-menu.htm"
        target="_blank" class="contact">create a Menu bar</a>, a counter showing
      the notifications count and the Notification window. The window (with id
      #notifications) remains hidden.</p>
    <p>CSS</p>
    <div class="frmname">The Markup</div>
    <p>Create a menu that will rest on the top of the page. For notifications
      window, I have added a &lt;div&gt; element with id <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000;">notifications</span>.
      It remains hidden when the page loads. See the style above for this
      element. It remains inside the &lt;li&gt; tag with id <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000;">noti_Container</span>,
      which serves as a parent container.</p>
    <p>HTML</p>
    <p>Inside the <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000;">noti_Container</span>
      &lt;li&gt; list, I have also added two more &lt;div&gt; elements, one each
      to display a counter (the small red counter on top) for notifications
      count and another DIV than serves as a button, but looks like Circle. When
      you click the button, it will show the Notifications window popping up.</p>
    <p>The red counter element (id = “noti_Counter”) get the numbers <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000;">dynamically</span>
      in the script section of this example. You can assign the numbers by
      extracting data from a remote data source such as, SQL Server or XML using
      Ajax. However, I am using a static figure for the example.</p>
    <div class="frmname">The jQuery Script</div>
    <p>When the page loads, the <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000;">noti_Counter</span>
      element is assigned with a static figure of <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000;">7</span>
      and it animatedly scrolls down and rest over the notifications icon (a
      circle here) on the menu bar. Please check the <a href="http://www.encodedna.com/jquery/demo/showing-facebook-style-notifications-popup-window.htm"
        target="_blank" class="contact">demo</a>.</p>
    <p>JavaScript</p>
    <div class="frmname">Conclusion</div>
    <p>Like I said, its just an example to show how you can mimic a popular
      design to learn some basic jQuery methods and CSS properties. The
      notifications window is empty. You can add dynamic data to it to make look
      more realistic. I have tried to make it look slightly different with
      animations and you too can experiment with new ideas and implement it your
      application.</p>
