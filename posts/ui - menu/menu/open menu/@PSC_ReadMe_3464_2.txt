Title: A different kind of menu system
Description: This is an example to my way of creating a different kind of menu than the ordinary dropdown menus or java menus etc etc... though the concept propably needs lots of refining... and the graphics are not exactly top notch (sorry guys and girls it was done in the wee hours of the morning).
Please even if you dont like the concept or the script in my example... give me some feedback.
