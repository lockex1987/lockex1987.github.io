                The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the
                subject of
                towels. A towel, it says, is about the
                most massivelyuseful thing an interstellar hitch hiker can have. Partly it has great practical value -
                you
                can wrap it
                around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the
                brilliant
                marble-sanded
                beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which
                shine so redly
                on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for
                use
                in hand-to-hand-combat;
                wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast
                of
                Traal (a mindboggingly
                stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you - daft as a bush, but very
                ravenous);
                you can wave
                your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems
                to
                be clean
                enough. More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag:
                non-hitch hiker)
                discovers that a hitch hiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in
                possession of a
                toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet
                weather gear, space
                suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen
                other
                items that
                the hitch hiker might accidentally have "lost". What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch
                the
                length and
                breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows
                where
                his towel
                is is clearly a man to be reckoned with.
