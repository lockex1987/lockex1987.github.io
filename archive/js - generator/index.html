      <h2>JS generator</h2>
      <p>redux-saga có sử dụng.</p>
      <p>Generators are functions which can be exited and later re-entered.
        Their context (variable bindings) will be saved across re-entrances.</p>
      <p>Generators in JavaScript -- especially when combined with Promises --
        are a very powerful tool for asynchronous programming as they mitigate
        -- if not entirely eliminate -- the problems with callbacks, such as
        Callback Hell and Inversion of Control. However, an even simpler
        solution to these problems can be achieved with async functions.</p>
      <p>Calling a generator function does not execute its body immediately; an
        iterator object for the function is returned instead. When the
        iterator's next() method is called, the generator function's body is
        executed until the first yield expression, which specifies the value to
        be returned from the iterator or, with yield*, delegates to another
        generator function. The next() method returns an object with a value
        property containing the yielded value and a done property which
        indicates whether the generator has yielded its last value, as a
        boolean. Calling the next() method with an argument will resume the
        generator function execution, replacing the yield expression where
        execution was paused with the argument from next().</p>
      <p>A return statement in a generator, when executed, will make the
        generator finish (i.e. the done property of the object returned by it
        will be set to true). If a value is returned, it will be set as the
        value property of the object returned by the generator.</p>
      <p>Much like a return statement, an error thrown inside the generator will
        make the generator finished -- unless caught within the generator's
        body.</p>
      <p>When a generator is finished, subsequent next() calls will not execute
        any of that generator's code, they will just return an object of this
        form: {value: undefined, done: true}.</p>
