        <h3>Ảnh clip-path và shape-outside</h3>

        <div>
            <img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/495197/0st9yhngses-benjamin-child.jpg" class="shape-image" />

  <p>Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or
    twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, ‘and what
    is the use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or conversations?’</p>
  <p>So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and
    stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the
    daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>
  <p>There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit
    say to itself, ‘Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!’ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that
    she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took
    a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it
    flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take
    out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it
    pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p>

        <h3>SVG clip-path masking effect</h3>

        
        <div id="content" class="mb-3">
            <img id="img" src="images/picture.png">

            <svg width="0" height="0">
                <clippath id="mask"></clippath>
            </svg>
        </div>

        <div class="mb-3 text-center">
            <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="50" class="slider" id="controlRange"/>
        </div>

        <p>You can control the effect using the slider in the bottom center. With the variables gridCellsX and gridCellsY
            you can determine how many elements the effect should consist of. The SVG elements are created dynamically in
            the clipPath element and their properties are manipulated as needed. </p>
