            calculus as an intellectual pastime, called "wasan" (Japanese
            algebra). However, rather than finding practical real-world
            applications for it, wasan masters would paint their problems and
            solutions on votive boards ("sangaku") to be donated to shinto
            shrines. This chapter discusses wasan, sangaku and the potential
